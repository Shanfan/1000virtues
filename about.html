  		<h1>1,000Virtues Dance</h1>
  		<h4>Besides providing company classes, formal rehearsal and repertory performance, I aim to take dance off of its performative pedestal through teaching and practice. Dance is for anyone and everyone who has an impulse to move and a need to express themselves.</h4>
  		<p>My movement is influenced by my various training in ballet, classical modern, works I have done with Francesca Harper (formerly with The Forsythe Company), Nathan Trice/RITUALS, studies with Alonzo King of LINES Ballet, and training in tai-chi, yoga and martial arts. It’s playful, fluid, sensual, intricate and luscious.</p>

<p>I’m looking for dancers who will commit to company training and performances on a regular basis. Dancers are often asked to use my idea,  story and phrases to improvise, to co-create, and to own the movement. Ideal candidates are expected to have a strong sense of musicality, and the desire to express themselves through movement. It may be uncomfortable not being given steps and counts, but if you are willing to dance between spontaneity and structure, I would love to see what we can come up with together!</p>

      <h1>I have a secret.</h1>
	  <p>Almost more than anything, I love to dance. </p>
	  
	  <p>It started in ballet class when I got to forget about everything else and just move my body in the space to music.  Mrs. Merrill, my beloved ballet teacher, encouraged me to make dances at a very young age, so I did.  And I loved being able to tell a story or just plain express myself without having to use words.  Dance class became my sanctuary, my favorite place to be, my home base, where it was safe to be in my body and to just plain be me.</p>
	  
	  <p>So why is this a secret?</p>
    </div>


          <div class="five columns article p2">
        <h4>A very special part of me comes alive in dance; the part that gets crushed either by choice or by circumstance in our daily life.  The part of me that gets to be totally and utterly honest without having to say a thing.  That part of me that can’t use words or money or stuff to just be happy about being alive, that part comes alive when I dance.</h4>

        <p>Sometimes I take a step back and look at this dance thing that I have dedicated my life to, and it still baffles me every time -- wow, what a dance nut I am, I think to myself.  It’s true.  No matter how hard it can be and perhaps will be (?), no matter how much I have wanted to or tried to walk away from dance, no matter what setting, be it sidewalk, studio, school or stage, dancing nourishes me in a way that nothing else has, can or will.  Nothing beats the feeling of walking out of a ballet class that just kicked me in my butt and got me sweating and reaching for that next layer.  Or the feeling before you are about to perform choreography that you just LOVE.  And the feeling you get after the adrenaline of the show is over.  Then hearing feedback about how your body, your moves, your story, your expression, your SELF inspired new thoughts, feelings, emotions in someone else.</p>
      </div>

    </div>
    <div class="row">
      
    <div class="five columns article p3">
      <p>And I have so much respect for my fellow dancers, who wake up, put on the sweats, walk into class, set up the barres, put on the music and get the moves on.  Dancers who thank each other for showing up, dancers who thank the teachers and the accompanists for being there, dancers who help each other out, most likely for free just because we see no other way.  Dancers who take risks, dancers who stand up for the craft, dancers who commit to growth through movement.  Dancers who work their butts off, who don’t complain, who show up and who just shut up and dance.</p>
      <p>So there you have it.</p>

	      <h5>Angie Conte</h5>
	      <p>is a choreographer, dancer, and artist living in Boston MA. She is the choreographer/artistic director of Angie Moon Dance Theatre, and also dances with Kairos Dance Theater. She earned a BA in Dance Performance and Visual Art Studies from Roger Williams University. As a student two pieces she choreographed for the RWU Dance Theatre were selected to be presented for adjudication at the American College Dance Festival. One of those pieces was then selected for the National Gala in Washington, D.C. at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.</p>

<p>She has also presented work in Rhode Island, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Florida. She has conducted teaching/choreography residencies at Colby Sawyer College, Roger Williams University, and University of New Hampshire. Angie was recently asked to be a part of the NADINE Project, (New Artists Dance In New England). There she is being mentored in creating new pieces by Janet Mansfield Soares, and Libby Nye. She is teaching open classes in Boston, and also teaching at many local studios and workshops around New England and Florida, including the Carlene Nazarian Dance Center, New Hampshire School Of Ballet, Creative Steps Studio of Dance, A Dance Vision By Nicole, Dance Productions, Nancy Dance Studio and the UNH Summer Dance Intensive.

	      <h5>Leah Riklin</h5>
	      <p>is a being who, at her core, needs to move.  She started dancing with Boston Ballet at age 5, and at age 12 decided to expand her repertoire by switching to Joanne Langione Dance Center (where she danced extensively through High School).  She graduated from American University with a BA in Acting in 2009, and since then, has continued to play around with varying forms of movement (aerials, rock climbing, and yoga, to name a few).</p>

<p>After a year and a half stint in the Red Rocks of Utah working in Wilderness Therapy, she has found herself back East in Cambridge.  With the Dance Complex right in her backyard, Leah has naturally made her way back to the Dance Community. There are no words to describe what it is like for her to be dancing again, and she feels grateful to Chien-Hwe for serendipitously dancing her way into her life at this time.</p>
